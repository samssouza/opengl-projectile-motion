# opengl-projectile-motion

This is a simple opengl game written using pyopengl. 
Some basic concepts of a render engine were used to render objects in a given world each frame as well as detect collision.
The objective is to throw the green ball and hit the blue box. The ball will follow a projectile throw motion until a collision is detected. 

Use the following keys to play:

- R(Keybord): Resets the game placing the target(blue box) in a random position.
- UP and DOWN(Arrows): Increase and decrease target size respectively
- Moving Mouse Pointer Over Canvas: Change the angle and velocity of projectile. Show as a white line in the canvas. 
- Right Mouse Click: Throws ball.
